# Alex Rinehart

Alex Rinehart is a writer, storyteller, and roleplaying game developer. Among his many hobbies is the desire to bend software into running in places it was never designed.

This blog is a place for thoughts, stories, and documentations of some of these adventures, as well as tutorials that can help others save time with knowledge shared.

If you like what you see here, or if any of the tutorials have brought you value or saved you time, consider picking up [one of my games](https://alrine.itch.io/).

## Three Beliefs

1. Software is a tool that should be used to save time.
2. Saved time should be spent doing enjoyable things. Everyone should be working less.
3. We have to look out for one another where we can.
