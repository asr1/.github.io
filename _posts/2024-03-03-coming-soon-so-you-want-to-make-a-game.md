I'm starting a new blog series called **So you want to make a game.** This series will cover various aspects of game design, creation, and publication including:

* How to source art on a budget?
* Learning layout as a beginner
* Marketing your game
* Finding playtesters
* Deciding when to call it done
* Navigating crowdfunding

And more!

The goal of this series is to collect knowledge valuable to creators of *all* experience levels. And it won't just be me sharing my insights: more than a dozen creators of tabletop roleplaying games and industry experts have agreed to share their knowledge with you. 

Stay tuned for this series of guest posts throughout the year!
