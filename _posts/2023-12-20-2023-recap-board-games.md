I played 54 unique board games this year. Of those, 14 were new to me this year: Imhotep, Just One, Patchwork, Red Rising, Dixit, Shadowrun: Zero Day, Encounters: Shadowrun, Level 7: Omega Protocol, Wavelength, Oath, Race for the Galaxy, Ransom Notes, A Handful of stars, and So You've Been Eaten.

Most of these 54 games I just played once, though I played more than a dozen games each of Decrypto and Word Slam (both light party games, **Decrypto** is a perpetual favorite of mine).

Usually I play through a legacy game, but this year my group didn't start a new one (what with 'real life' and starting families taking precedence). Instead, we mostly focused on lighter games, or one-off story games like **T.I.M.E. Stories**. 

My favorite new game of the year is **Just One**. My least favorite is Encounters: Shadowrun, which I played once and will likely never play again (the other players felt the same way).

The game I'm most eager to play again is A Handful of Stars, which will probably result in me selling A Few Acres of Snow, as it seems to be a strictly better replacement. 

This was the year of **party games** for me, with lots of plays of Spyfall, Telestrations, Coup, Wavelengths, Welcome To, Dixit, Word Slam, Skull, and Decrypto, and only 2 plays of **Scythe**, our go-to 'heavy' game. **Clank**, a solid medium-weight got 4 plays, and would have gotten more, except I needed a break, as all four of those plays were within a couple of weeks. 

I'm looking forward next year to some more medium-weight games. This year I played two excellent games of **Lords of Waterdeep,** as well as some Red Rising and **Bruxelles 1897**.

**Legendary: Marvel** continues to be popular at my house, though it shines with 2 or 3, and I would never recommend it at 4 or 5 (a common problem with many deck builders, especially in the river style).

My most satisfying game of the year was **In The Hall of the Mountain King**, which never fails to delight. I also defended my undefeated streak at **Rising Sun** (though lost my perfect record in Red Rising).

**Quacks of Quedlinburg** is one I expect to be the Clank of next year, medium length and popular with guests and visitors. I also expect to bring Spirit Island to table more often; I've been playing a lot of that digitally, and we just recently picked up the 5-6 player expansion.

*Bolded games are ones I particularly enjoy, though T.I.M.E. Stories rides the line of getting that distinction.*
