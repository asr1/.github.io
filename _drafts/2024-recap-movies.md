Below is the list of movies I've seen this year, very roughly sorted by how much I enjoyed them (least favorite at the top, favorite at the bottom). Commentary included for select movies.

* **Moneyball**
* **Asteroid City**
* **Goldfinger**
* **Venom 2: Let There Be Carnage** *Not nearly as charming as the first. Lots of callbacks to jokes that were done better the first time around.*

* **The Disruptors**
* **The Goldfinch**
* **All the Presidentâ€™s Men**
* **From Russia with Love**
* **North By Northwest**
* **21 Jump Street (2012)** *Brie Larson can act! Turns out her wooden Captain Marvel was a directoral decision.
 
* **Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking barrels** *Basically a game of Fiasco with a baller soundtrack. Unusual cinematography at times.*

* **The Mighty Ducks**
* **Murder on the Orient Express (2017)**
* **Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves** *Really fun adventure movie, in the style of The Mummy. The tiefling design was cowardice, but fun all around.*
* **His Girl Friday**
