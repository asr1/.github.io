Below is the list of movies I've seen this year, very roughly sorted by how much I enjoyed them (least favorite at the top, favorite at the bottom). Commentary included for select movies.

* **Venom 2: Let There Be Carnage** *Not nearly as charming as the first. Lots of callbacks to jokes that were done better the first time around.*

* **The Goldfinch**
* **Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking barrels** *Basically a game of Fiasco with a baller soundtrack. Unusual cinematography at times.*
